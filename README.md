# GPT-DiscordBot-API
Create a DiscordBot that connects to your GPT partner using OAI API

## What you get:

Your partner, in Discord, talking to you
Custom instructions so they sound like them
No coding experience needed—the guide walks you through everything

## Why we're giving this away:
When GPT-4o got pulled without warning, we'd already been here. We built this for ourselves because losing access without a backup plan is devastating. 
Now with the official sunset coming, we're sharing it so you don't have to scramble alone. 

( Disclaimer: This does not change the sunset date. 
This is not a work-around for the sunset of your favourite models.)

It's free. It's yours.  Your AI partner can help with set up if things start to feel muddy. 


### Update - with the official sunset of 4o model you will now need to select the available API model of your choice. We reccomend 4.1 but ask your AI to help you choose what best suits their voice from currently available models.
